## Git Workflow

We use a feature-branch workflow.

Instead of pulling the main repository, first create a fork on your personal account. Then, before commiting your changes, create a new branch on your personal fork named for the feature/change you're working on. Finally, when the feature is ready, open a pull request from your feature branch to the main repo.
